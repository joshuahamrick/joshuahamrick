### ðŸ‘‹ Hello

I'm Josh! The Lead Software and Marketing Engineer at Adventureworks.

I graduated from NSS, specializing in C#/.NET, SQL, and React. I've since contributed to multiple projects now in production, which has provided me with exposure to Next.js, TypeScript, ArcGIS, Mapbox and Tailwind CSS. 

I love to tinker with other languages and different AI products as they are developed! May get into making some of my own soon.. Interested in Blockchain and Cryptography. ðŸ¤–

I'm open to work and love to chat about all things tech. Give me a shout!
