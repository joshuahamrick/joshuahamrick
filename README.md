👋 Hello! 

😌 I'm Joshua, a full stack developer with a unique journey from building my first computer in high school to completing a web development program at NSS. I specialize in C#/.NET, SQL, and React.

💻 I'm currently spending my time with Harvard's CS50 and AWS training. Fresh out of Nashville Software School and eager to dive into the tech industry! I'm interested in learning more about cryptology and steganography, especially as it relates to Web3 and Blockchain technologies as I advance in my career.
Check out my projects and let me know if I could be a fit!
