ðŸ‘‹ Hello! 

I'm Joshua, a full stack developer with a unique journey from building my first computer in high school to completing a web development program at NSS. I specialize in C#/.NET, SQL, and React.

ðŸ’» I'm currently enhancing my skills with Harvard's CS50 and AWS training. Fresh out of Nashville Software School and eager to dive into the tech industry! I'm interested in learning more about cryptology and steganography especially in line with web3 and blockchain as I advance in my career.
Check out my projects here on GitHub!
