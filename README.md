### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, 

ðŸ˜Š I'm Josh, a full stack developer with a long journey from building my first computer in high school to completing a web development program at NSS. I specialize in C#/.NET, SQL, and React.

ðŸ’» I'm currently spending my time with Harvard's CS50 and AWS training. Fresh out of Nashville Software School and eager to dive into the tech industry! 

ðŸ¤– I'm interested in learning more about cryptology and steganography - especially as it relates to Web3 and Blockchain technologies as I advance in my career.

ðŸ’ª Check out my projects and let me know if I could be a fit!
